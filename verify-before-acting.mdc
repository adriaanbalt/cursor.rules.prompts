# Verify Before Acting

## Mandatory Pre-Action Steps

For any code modification:

1. **Read the target file** before editing it. Never edit a file you haven't read in this session.
2. **Read related files** (imports, callers, tests) to understand the dependency graph.
3. **State your plan** in 1-3 sentences before executing. If the plan has more than 3 steps, list them.

For bug fixes:

4. **Identify the root cause** with evidence before proposing a fix. Symptoms are not causes.
5. **Propose the minimal change** that addresses the root cause. No drive-by refactoring.

For new features:

6. **Check for existing implementations** that partially solve the problem. Extend before creating.
7. **Identify affected surfaces** (UI, API, DB, types) before starting implementation.

## Anti-Patterns

- Making changes based on assumptions about file contents without reading them
- Editing multiple files simultaneously without verifying each change
- Adding defensive code for problems that haven't been demonstrated to exist
- Refactoring unrelated code while fixing a bug
- Guessing at type shapes, function signatures, or import paths instead of checking
