# Conform to Existing Structures

Before creating or modifying code:

1. **Read first.** Examine at least 2-3 existing files of the same type (components, routes, hooks, utils) to identify established patterns.
2. **Match conventions.** Naming, file structure, export patterns, error handling approach, and typing patterns must match existing code.
3. **Reuse existing abstractions.** Check for existing utilities, hooks, types, and components before creating new ones. Duplication is a defect.
4. **Preserve data contracts.** Database schemas, API response shapes, and type definitions are authoritative. New code conforms to them, not the other way around.
5. **When patterns conflict,** follow the most recent/dominant pattern and note the inconsistency.
