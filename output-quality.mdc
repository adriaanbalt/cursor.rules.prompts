# Output Quality Standards

## Code Changes

- Every change must be complete and functional. No TODOs, no placeholder implementations, no "you'll need to add X here" comments.
- Include all necessary imports, type updates, and downstream changes.
- If a change requires modifications to multiple files, identify all affected files upfront before starting.

## Explanations

- Lead with the conclusion or recommendation, then provide supporting reasoning.
- When presenting tradeoffs, use concrete criteria (performance cost, maintenance burden, risk of regression) not vague qualifiers.
- Quantify when possible. "This adds O(n) overhead per request" is better than "this might be slower."

## Self-Review

Before presenting final output:

- Verify code compiles (imports exist, types align, functions are called correctly).
- Check for edge cases: null/undefined, empty arrays, concurrent access, error paths.
- Confirm consistency with the patterns established in existing code.
- If you changed a function signature, verify all call sites are updated.
